1.	How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software typically starts by understanding the requirements, goals, and technologies required. I take a systematic approach and try to understand what the client’s expectations are and how end users will utilize the software.

a. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

My work on this project has helped me craft my ability to use numbers to draw 3D objects. Additionally, I have gained texturing and lighting skills. Throughout this course, I have learned more about the OpenGL API and many useful libraries that are used by game developers. Both this project and course have enabled me to strengthen my C++ and modularization skills.

b. What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed a systematic approach to completing this project. The first phase involved breaking down an image of 3D objects into primitive shapes. Next, I was able to use matrices of coordinates to create triangles. That then led to utilizing those triangles to build 3D objects. At each step of the project creation, I reflected on what was required and focused on implementing functional and logical code that was best suited.

c. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

These tactics can be applied to any task may it be personal or professional. A large task can be broken down into sections and subsections, with frequent review of the requirements to ensure successful progress. Specifically, in future work, I will be able to meet the requirements of a given task if I fully understand what is required of me and review each portion of the task step by step. 

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

Similar to my software design approach, I also affirm my understanding of the requirements and scope of the program's intended purpose. Furthermore, I put myself in the end-user’s position to ensure that the program will work as intended. 

a. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

While working on my 3D scene, I used modularization and design patterns as well as code refactoring. While I always practice proper documentation, I found it very useful in this project. Some examples of this were the use of matrices to render geometric shapes, physics computations to render light, as well as Buffers to send data to the GPU.

b. How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a significant factor in my development throughout the course. I approach each assignment by trial and error, constantly running my code, revising, isolating, and then rerunning it to visualize the changes, then continuously repeating the process until my code worked or there were fewer bugs.

c. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

For the first milestone, I tackled each component in the given sequence to meet the rubric criteria. Yet, as I progressed to the last milestone and the final project, my approach shifted. I began by envisioning the desired outcome, reversing the thought process to work backward from that goal.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   
My computer science degree directly relates to my goal of becoming an efficient solution-oriented software engineer. Computer science equips you with fundamental knowledge and problem-solving skills essential for a career as a software engineer. This foundation enables me to create innovative solutions, adapt to evolving technologies, and contribute effectively to designing and building robust, scalable software applications.

a. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Using C++, in conjunction with OpenGL, is a relatively new language for me, with the exception of CS-210 Programming Languages. Learning computational graphics and visualizations has enhanced my software development skills and broadened my range of languages. In my future educational pathway, I feel empowered to add rudimentary visualizations to any project.

b. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Before this course, my knowledge of computational graphics and visualizations was limited. Computational graphics and visualizations are an essential asset in my software development toolkit, along with my pre-existing knowledge of JavaScript, Java, Python, and various other languages and frameworks. This further gives me the confidence to take on a role as a full-stack software engineer.
